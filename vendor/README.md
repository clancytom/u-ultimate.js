If a different version becomes available, it must be manually downloaded and replaced in the
repository.

Should yarn support requiring zip archives in the future (see
[yarn github issue: Zip support](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1483)),
we can remove the libraries from the repository and add them to the package.json.
